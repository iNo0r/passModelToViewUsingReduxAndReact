2- combine the model using redux 
import {combineReducers} from 'redux';

3- create store of the combined model using redux 
import { createStore } from 'redux';
4- pass it to the parent component  provider using react-redux
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

5- receive it but connect and pass the state to props using react-redux
import {connect} from 'react-redux'

now props ready to be used and displayed
